# Mission-to-Mars

# Summary
* The purpose for this repository was to create a web app that scraped full-resolution images of Mar's hemisphere, as well as scrape factual data and the most recent news headlines on Mars. This information is scraped through the web and stored into a Mongo database, which renders with our website to display a neatly organized, centralized datahub through our web app.

* The website is also mobile friendly due to including bootstrap's mobile container codes.

* The web app is organized with bootstrap, first displaying the latest news, featured image, and a Mars Facts dataframe. Below that, we have included full-resolution images of the different hemispheres.
